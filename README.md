### Basic uart sender/receiver
### tx is build in go rx, in ino(c)
### the schematics for the arduino build can be found at the site of ben eater
### the rx part is also for the biggest part of ben eater. The only difference is the possibility to send the hex data directly via the tx app. So the data does not have to be compiled with the arduino everytime.
### output can be watched with for example minicom with a baudrate of 57600
